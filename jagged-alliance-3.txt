TIPS - these were learned through trial and error, I would recommend getting the same experience
  I'm Skint! - Keep an eye on for diamond shipments and search every corner, militia men seem to have holes in their pockets. 
  I'm Broke! - Diamond mines are a lucrative if somewhat questionable means of long term wealth 
  Who can disarm this? - disarm means boom, disable means mech
  Keep stepping on mines? - Have a stealth demo available 
  Can you hear me? - Your characters dont have to be near a conversation to be in it
  Will this blow me up? - mines have no idea who the fuck you are
  Will I get this back? - Defusing mines does not return them to your inventory, you fucked the wires up mate
  I will fight to the last! - it gets real hard to fight to the last if you kill off all their friends and put a bullet in their leg

KEYBINDS
  tactical:
  ESC ESCAPE THAT FUCKING ACTION - this one is not even in the keybinds so I think its intentionally for you to figure out: stops the current action when not in TB mode, very useful
  N baNdage - medical treatment
  J Just get out of the way - take cover
  H Hide - activate sneak
  U Use a different weapon - swap between loadouts 1 & 2
  T Top - Change view up a floor
  G Ground - Change view down a floor
  ALT ALTernatively just have a look around - pins discovered interactions as little blue boxes in your ui

  strategic:
  C Cee the mercs - view merc info
  J Just get organised - organise squads
